A collection of thoughts about my time working as a Research Assistant at my university, in my final year of studies.

Topics: 
  - Academia
  - Studying
  - Machine Learning
  - Experimentation

Themes: 
  -  Why I decided to leave and work within software engineering.
  -  What it is like working for a university/
  -  How to better support a research assistant

Points:
  - ... was my first proper job coming out of university ...
  - ... a springboard to my next job ...
  - ... felt like I was suffering from some version of impostor syndrome, except maybe I actually was not qualified, not just thinking I was ...
  - ... a lack of feeling like progress was made was not encouraging enough to allow me to keep feeling enthusiastic about the project ...
  - ... an overwhelming research area with an endless amount of rabbit holes ...
