A collection of thoughts about my time working as a Research Assistant at my university, in my final year of studies.

### Rough Draft 

My first opportunity to get paid for what I study, and to do what I study was when I was offered to work as a research assistant at the University of Technology Sydney in early 2018. I had done a capstone project, and my supervising professor liked the work I had done and offered me to stay on for a while and work on a project he was leading. The project is called a capstone because it is a sort of finishing touch on a bachelor student's degree. A thesis of sorts. I immediately accepted the offer since I was working in retail at that time and was getting very tired of putting clothes on hangers.

I came on working part time during my final semester at the university, so I was juggling studies with work which turned out quite nicely since there was a healthy amount of subject overlap between the courses I did and the things I did at my new role. The commute was also close to nothing which was great. 

In the first couple of months I had a strong sense of being thrown in the deep end. I had practiced academic writing for university assignments, but getting paid to do research and running overnight experiments? I was blissfully unaware of how many things I did not know I did not know. 

The work itself was centered around this genomic dataset taken from roughly 200 children and young adults around the New South Wales area that had contracted Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The idea 'slash' hypothesis was that some sort of risk stratification could be done by looking at the dataset and running it through some machine learning models. This was, as I'm sure you can imagine, not a very straightforward problem and a lot of the work I did was to try and figure out if there was something tangible in the dataset, and if such an conclusion could even be drawn in the first place.

There were no significant conclusions that could be drawn as a result of the work that I did during my time at the university, what I did contribute with however, was a lot of new ways of visualising the datasets. And a major rewrite of the current project codebase.

There were a few things that made the experience worse than what it could have been. One of the major reasons why I left the role was the fact that I was working completely alone. I have no problem tackling projects by myself but when working for weeks on end with only one face to face meeting per week you need to have solid incentives. This would for me personally be a combination of the following: a great working culture with supportive colleagues, a clear goal for what is being achieved, adequent monetary compensation and a belief in that the work you are doing is meaningful. I grew quite disillusioned by the end of the project, I didn't think that the work I was doing would have any significant impact since the datasets I was working with were so limited in size. 

Looking back, there were a lot of things I learnt during this time that helped me later on. I figured out how to design and run long term experimentation. I got WAY better att navigating filesystems and setting up SSH tunnels etc. I got to read up on and practice a ton of different Deep Neural Network models.
